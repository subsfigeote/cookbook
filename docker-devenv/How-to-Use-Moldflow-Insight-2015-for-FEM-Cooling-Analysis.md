# How to Use Moldflow Insight 2015 for FEM Cooling Analysis
 
Moldflow Insight 2015 is a powerful software that allows you to simulate the injection molding process and optimize your part design, material selection, and molding conditions. One of the features of Moldflow Insight 2015 is the finite element method (FEM) cooling analysis, which calculates both steady state and transient mold temperatures. This can help you improve the quality of your molded parts by reducing warpage, shrinkage, and residual stresses.

In this article, we will show you how to use Moldflow Insight 2015 for FEM cooling analysis on a 4-cavity tool on the computer mouse cover. You will learn how to:
 
- Create a project and import a study
- Set the analysis sequence
- Create the cooling lines and mold boundary
- Mesh the mold
- Input the process settings and run the analysis
- Review the results

## Create a project and import a study
 
The first step is to create a new project in Moldflow Insight 2015. To do this, click File > New > Project. Give your project a name and a location. Then, click OK.
 
The next step is to import a study that contains the mesh part model. You can download the model files for this tutorial [here](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/moldflow-insight/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/MoldflowInsight/files/GUID-01F14CC6-6D6C-4503-A6E9-4443A2D6EC9B-htm.html). To import a study, click Home > Import > Import. Select Study files (\*.sdy) as the file type. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the model files and select model\_4\_analysis.sdy. Click Open.
 
## Set the analysis sequence
 
The analysis sequence determines what types of analyses will be performed on your model. For this tutorial, we will use the Fill + Cool + Fill+Pack + Warp sequence, which includes filling, packing, cooling, and warpage analyses. To set the analysis sequence, click Home > Analysis Sequence > Fill + Cool + Fill+Pack + Warp.
 
## Create the cooling lines and mold boundary
 
The cooling lines are the channels that carry the coolant fluid through the mold. The mold boundary is the surface that defines the shape and size of the mold. To create the cooling lines and mold boundary, you need to use Synergy, which is a graphical user interface for Moldflow Insight 2015. To launch Synergy, click Home > Synergy.
 
In Synergy, you will see a tree view of your model on the left pane and a 3D view of your model on the right pane. To create the cooling lines, click Model > Cooling Lines > Create Cooling Lines. A dialog box will appear where you can specify the parameters of your cooling lines, such as diameter, pitch, offset, direction, etc. You can also use predefined templates or import existing cooling lines from other studies. For this tutorial, we will use the default parameters and create four straight cooling lines along each side of the mold.
 
To create the mold boundary, click Model > Mold Boundary > Create Mold Boundary. A dialog box will appear where you can specify the parameters of your mold boundary, such as thickness, offset, material, etc. You can also use predefined templates or import existing mold boundaries from other studies. For this tutorial, we will use the default parameters and create a rectangular mold boundary around the part.
 
## Mesh the mold
 
The mesh is a discretization of your model into small elements that are used for numerical calculations. The quality of your mesh affects the accuracy and speed of your analysis. To mesh the mold, you need to use Tetra Meshing Wizard, which is a tool that automatically generates tetrahedral elements for your model. To launch Tetra Meshing Wizard, click Model > Tetra Meshing Wizard.
 
In Tetra Meshing Wizard, you will see a list of steps on the left pane and a 3D view of your model on the
